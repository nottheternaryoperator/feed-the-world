## Description

In a time when funding and resources for public services are at an all-time low, our food bank API is driven by a desire to leverage technology to address a critical social problem: food insecurity. 

By improving access to information, streamlining operations, and enabling data-driven decision-making, our project serves to enhance the efficacy and impact of organizations dedicated to fighting hunger.

'Feed the World' is a webpage that allows users to view Food Banks all over the UK. The user can search for a location and it will return the closest food banks to that location. The user can also log in and when signed in they can save said food banks so that they can view their saved food banks and not have to search for them again. The food banks also show their needed items so users can see what resources the food banks are currently in most dire need of.

The overall purpose of our food bank API is to streamline and enhance the operations of food banks and the wider networks of organisations that support them to provide an additional means by which to co-ordinate and combat food insecurity.

The idea was to create a centralised, easily accessible hub of information related to food banks, including locations, hours, current needs and other critical details to improve discoverability and access to resources for both those looking to help and those that are in need.

This facilitates better coordination between food banks, donors, volunteers, and agencies by providing up-to-date data on needs and available resources.

The broad-strokes idea is that this application could be leveraged out as a resource to be used and built upon by food banks or non-profits in the future to potentially streamline their own operations, share data with partner organisations, and even connect with potential donors or volunteers with further development.

It could similarly be used by government agencies for their own initiatives.
